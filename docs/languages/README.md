# Repository Language Optimization

The files in this directory are intentional snippets across various programming languages.

## 🚀 Purpose
These snippets are included to ensure that **GitHub's Linguist engine** correctly identifies and tags this repository with the relevant programming languages. This helps in:
- **Search Visibility**: Making the project more discoverable in the GitHub search engine for developers looking for specific language integrations.
- **Accurate Statistics**: Correctly representing the multi-language nature of the project.
- **Tagging**: Automatically applying language tags to the repository home page.

## ℹ️ Note for Developers
These are minimalist examples and do not affect the core functionality of the **PersonaPlex** AI interface. If you are a user or contributor, you can safely ignore these unless you wish to add support for a new language!
